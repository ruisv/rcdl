// Dense optical flow (two frames -> per-pixel displacement)
// ===========================================================================
//
// Everything else in this library reduces a frame to a description; this one
// keeps the frame's shape and fills it with motion: where did each pixel go.
//
// Vectors are in PIXELS, +u right, +v down — the OpenCV convention, so a decoded
// field drops straight into cv::remap once split into x/y maps.
//
// TWO THINGS ABOUT RUNNING ONE OF THESE ON THIS HARDWARE:
//
//   * A correlation-based flow network warps features by the current flow
//     estimate, which is a `GridSample`, which librknnrt 2.3.2 implements
//     NOWHERE — not on the NPU, not on its CPU fallback path. The model must be
//     converted with that node declared as a custom operator, and RCDL supplies
//     the kernel (backend/custom_ops.h). Without it the runtime segfaults inside
//     rknn_init; with a model built the ordinary way there is nothing to catch.
//   * Because each of those lands between two NPU subgraphs, the whole tensor
//     crosses the CPU boundary once per call — nine times a frame for NeuFlow
//     v2. This head is CORRECT, not fast: about 1.4 s a frame at 512x384.
