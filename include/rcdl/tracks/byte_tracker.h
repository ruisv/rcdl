// ByteTrack multi-object tracker (pure algorithm, no model)
// ===========================================================================
//
// Associates per-frame detection boxes into temporally stable tracklets, each
// carrying a persistent `track_id`. This is a faithful C++ port of the classic
// ByteTrack reference (Zhang et al., ECCV 2022): an 8-dimensional constant-
// velocity Kalman filter predicts each tracklet forward, and a TWO-STAGE
// IoU association recovers both confident and low-confidence detections:
//
//   1. High-score detections are matched (IoU, score-fused) against the union
//      of currently-tracked and recently-lost tracklets.
//   2. Remaining still-tracked tracklets get a SECOND chance to match the
//      leftover low-score detections (this is the "BYTE" idea — keep the weak
//      boxes instead of discarding them, to bridge occlusions).
//   3. Unconfirmed (single-frame) tracklets match the leftover high-score
//      detections; unmatched ones are dropped immediately.
//   4. Leftover high-score detections above `high_thresh` spawn new tracklets.
//   5. Lost tracklets older than `max_time_lost` frames are removed.
//
// This runs entirely on the CPU and never touches an Engine: it consumes boxes,
// not pixels, so it costs the NPU nothing and can be unit-tested off the board.
//
// Coordinates are ORIGINAL-image pixels throughout (the same convention as
// `rcdl::Detection`); the model->original un-letterbox is assumed done already
// by the detector. The detection's `class_id` is passed through to the matched
// track's output for convenience.
//
// APPEARANCE (ReID). Geometry alone loses an identity whenever a target is
// occluded for longer than the motion model stays believable, or when two
// targets cross. Passing a per-detection appearance embedding to the two-argument
// `update()` switches on BoT-SORT association: each tracklet keeps an
// EMA-smoothed embedding template, and the first association's cost becomes
//
//     cost = min(IoU_dist, gated_cosine_dist)
//
// so appearance can only ever RESCUE a match that geometry was about to miss —
// it never vetoes one. Two gates keep it from inventing matches: a pair whose
// raw IoU distance exceeds `proximity_thresh` is too far apart to be the same
// object no matter how similar it looks, and a cosine distance above
// `appearance_thresh` is not similar enough to count. The low-score second
// association stays pure IoU (its crops are the blurry / occluded ones whose
// embeddings are least trustworthy). Embeddings come from a ReID model run over
// the detection crops — see `tracks/reid.h`.
